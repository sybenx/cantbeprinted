            <h2>My Journey to Financial Security</h2>
            <p>My initial distrust of the dollar began in 2017 when I had saved $12,000 at one of my first jobs after being there for a while. I realized the housing market was outpacing my savings, so I gave up saving and just started spending on whatever I wanted. I didn’t know what to do.</p>
            <p>Fast forward to 2024, I had an existential crisis around April regarding finance and remembered a podcast exploring Bitcoin which I’d listened to years ago. I decided to revisit, and the podcaster overhearing some men at a Bitcoin conference intrigued me. These guys really believed that Bitcoin would grow so much that it would make them, early adopters, mega-rich, like oligarchs of the future. I don’t know where these guys are now, but it struck the podcaster and me. I ruminated on this a bit and did more research. I stumbled upon a Nostr Bitcoin community around the same time and watched a video about Witsand, South Africa, adopting Bitcoin as currency. I saw the confidence of that man too, and saw how he had guided those in his community towards Bitcoin, and their entire community had adopted it after a few years. They looked like they felt secure, and I wanted that. So I bought a little, read more, watched more videos. I read <em>The Bitcoin Standard</em>, and my confidence in it only increased, although my frustration with how complex Bitcoin is and how difficult it is to explain only grew.</p>
            <p>Bitcoin’s complexity can feel daunting, and I understand why some hesitate to share their stories due to privacy concerns. But I believe sharing journeys like mine can make Bitcoin more relatable. My goal with Can’t Be Printed isn’t to push Bitcoin as the only solution but to show how exploring it helped me feel secure. Starting small—buying a little Bitcoin, reading books, watching videos—built my confidence in a system that protects wealth without relying on traditional currencies that lose value over time.</p>
            <p>If you’re feeling uncertain about your financial future, you don’t need to trust anyone blindly. Research Bitcoin or other assets, start small, and you’ll find your own path to security. Can’t Be Printed is here to share knowledge and stories, not sales pitches, to help you take control of your wealth.</p>
