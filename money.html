            <h1 class="headline">How Inflation Affects You</h1>
            <p class="subheadline">Let’s break down why prices keep rising, what it means for your savings, and how you can respond with options like crypto, stocks, bonds, or property.</p>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Why Prices Keep Rising</h2>
                <p>You’ve likely noticed it—groceries, gas, and rent cost more each year. This is inflation, driven by central banks like the Federal Reserve printing money. They do this to fund government spending or boost the economy, like after 2020. Since the dollar left the gold standard in 1971, there’s no limit to how much can be printed. From 2020 to 2025, the money supply grew 38% (Federal Reserve data), pushing prices higher.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>What This Means for Your Savings</h2>
                <p>Inflation erodes your money’s value. If you had $100 in 2020, it buys only ~$82 worth of goods today (CPI data). In 2022, inflation hit 9%, outpacing most savings accounts. This can widen inequality—cash loses value, while those with assets like stocks or real estate often gain. It’s a challenge you’ve likely felt, but there are ways to respond.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Ways to Protect Your Savings</h2>
                <p>Inflation affects everyone, but you can take steps to protect your money. Here are four categories to consider: crypto, stocks, bonds, and property. Each has strengths and risks—think about what aligns with your goals.</p>
                
                <h3>Crypto</h3>
                <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, operating on decentralized networks. The total crypto market is worth ~$2.5 trillion (May 2025), with Bitcoin at ~$1.2 trillion and Ethereum at ~$350 billion (CoinMarketCap).</p>
                <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it resistant to inflation. It’s grown ~4,000% from 2015 to 2025. Ethereum supports smart contracts, enabling apps like DeFi.</p>
                <p><strong>Risks:</strong> Crypto can be volatile—Bitcoin dropped 20% in Q1 2025. Scams and regulatory uncertainty (e.g., SEC debates) are concerns. Many fear its complexity or hype around certain coins.</p>
                <p><strong>Consider:</strong> Does the potential for high growth outweigh the volatility for you? Are you comfortable with digital assets?</p>
                
                <h3>Stocks</h3>
                <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Shares in companies (e.g., Apple, Tesla) or ETFs like the S&P 500. The S&P 500 market cap is ~$50 trillion (May 2025).</p>
                <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Stocks often outpace inflation—the S&P 500 averages ~10% annual returns (Yahoo Finance). ETFs provide diversification, reducing risk.</p>
                <p><strong>Risks:</strong> Markets can dip—the S&P 500 fell 20% in 2022. Individual stocks carry higher risk if a company struggles.</p>
                <p><strong>Consider:</strong> Are you looking for steady growth over time? Can you handle market fluctuations?</p>
                
                <h3>Bonds</h3>
                <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Debt securities like U.S. Treasury bonds, offering fixed returns. Treasuries yield ~3-4% in 2025 (Treasury.gov).</p>
                <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Bonds are low risk—government bonds are nearly guaranteed. They provide predictable income, and options like TIPS adjust with inflation.</p>
                <p><strong>Risks:</strong> Returns can lag inflation—a 3% yield loses value if inflation is 9%, as in 2022. Selling early can lead to losses if interest rates rise.</p>
                <p><strong>Consider:</strong> Do you prioritize safety over growth? Are you okay with lower returns to preserve your capital?</p>
                
                <h3>Property</h3>
                <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Real estate, such as homes or rentals, or REITs. Global real estate is worth ~$300 trillion (Zillow estimate).</p>
                <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Property often grows with inflation—U.S. home prices rose ~5% annually from 2020 to 2025 (Zillow). Rentals can provide steady income.</p>
                <p><strong>Risks:</strong> It’s expensive—median U.S. home price is ~$400,000 (2025). Maintenance, taxes, and illiquidity (hard to sell quickly) are challenges.</p>
                <p><strong>Consider:</strong> Do you have the capital for property? Are you looking for a tangible asset with potential income?</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Reflect and Decide</h2>
                <p>Inflation is a reality, but you have options. Crypto like Bitcoin offers inflation resistance, stocks provide growth, bonds ensure safety, and property brings stability. Think about your priorities—growth, safety, or tangibility—and choose what feels right for you.</p>
